# HexSoftware_ExploratoryDataAnalysis

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project examines student data using NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis consists of three steps: understanding the data (summary stats, distribution), cleaning the data (handling missing values, outliers), and relationship analysis (correlations, trends). The goal is to uncover hidden insights, identify relationships, and inform future analyses.
